# STANDUP 01 - 2/9/2023

Project Team:
    Omama-DB

Main Objective
==============
0. Explore use of Kaggle data with DeepSight classifier
1. Remove bad images from 2D images using outlier detection.
2. Build out GP2 pipeline in order to tune existing classifiers
3. Build final mammography dataset for public release

General Update and Intro
========================
Team has been in communication via Discord and Zoom and project
leader was selected to be Ryan Zurrin because he already has some
experience with what needs to be done.

We have also established a GitHub Repo: https://github.com/RyanZurrin/CS410-Omama,
which has been forked by team members and team has started learning how to use
version control properly via syncing local branches, and creating pull requests.

Chimera cluster access has been requested and granted and team has begun setting
up environments on cluster which includes use of Anaconda for managing package
dependencies.


Draft of Requirments
====================
MAIN #1 : We will need to use GP2 API and start testing it's use on different datasets
with it's end goal to be used on improving existing classifiers, and in this case
DeepSight in particular.
To  achieve this task the following frameworks will be put to use:
    - TensorFlow and Keras
    - Training will be done on GPU nodes on HCP cluster so must learn how to use this

MAIN #2 : Outlier detection for removing unwanted images from final dataset
To achieve this goal the following framworks and tools will be used:
    - PyOD, Python library with focus on outlier detection
    - Hyperparameter optimazation library (exploring possible libraries in progress)
    - Experiment Tracking such as Weight and Biases or neptune.ai

MAIN #3 : Explore use of Kaggle Data with Deepsight
To achieve this goal we will use the following tools:
    - Pydicom python library for manipulating dicom header data
    - DeepSight classifier for testing changes to kaggle data
