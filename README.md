### Modern deep learning systems can detect breast cancer early when trained with large amounts of data. We want to create the worldâ€™s largest publicly-available annotated mammography dataset with a collection of 70,000 breast cancer imaging studies with ground truth labels. This dataset will also be the first publicly available dataset that includes both 3D Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) and 2D Digital Mammography (DM) studies. The number of images of the proposed OMAMA-DB makes fully manual labeling infeasible. To tackle this problem, we will design intelligent annotation methods that join machine learning with human annotators.

## Getting Started with environment setup

### Install the O conda environment by running the following command:
```  bash
conda env create -f O.yml
```

### Unofficial Usur study to  find percent of dataset that is bad.
